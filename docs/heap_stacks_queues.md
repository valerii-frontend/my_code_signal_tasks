# Heap, Stacks, Queues

## 💎kthLargestElement

### Task

Note: Avoid using built-in `std::nth_element` (or analogous built-in functions in languages other than C++) when solving this challenge. Implement them yourself, since this is what you would be asked to do during a real interview.

Find the `kth` largest element in an unsorted array. This will be the kth largest element in sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

### Example

```
For nums = [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1] and k = 2, the output should be
solution(nums, k) = 6;
For nums = [99, 99] and k = 1, the output should be
solution(nums, k) = 99.
```
