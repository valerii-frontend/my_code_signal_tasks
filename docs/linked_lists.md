# Linked Lists

## removeKFromList

### Task

Note: Try to solve this task in `O(n)` time using `O(1)` additional space, where `n` is the number of elements in the list, since this is what you'll be asked to do during an interview.

Given a singly linked list of integers `l` and an integer `k`, remove all elements from list `l` that have a value equal to `k`.

### Example

```
For l = [3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and k = 3, the output should be
solution(l, k) = [1, 2, 4, 5];
For l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and k = 10, the output should be
solution(l, k) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
```

## isListPalindrome

### Task

Note: Try to solve this task in O(n) time using O(1) additional space, where n is the number of elements in l, since this is what you'll be asked to do during an interview.

Given a singly linked list of integers, determine whether or not it's a `palindrome`.

Note: in examples below and tests preview linked lists are presented as arrays just for simplicity of visualization: in real data you will be given a head node l of the linked list

### Example

```
For l = [0, 1, 0], the output should be
solution(l) = true;

For l = [1, 2, 2, 3], the output should be
solution(l) = false.
```
