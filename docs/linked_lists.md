# Linked Lists

## removeKFromList

### Task

Note: Try to solve this task in `O(n)` time using `O(1)` additional space, where `n` is the number of elements in the list, since this is what you'll be asked to do during an interview.

Given a singly linked list of integers `l` and an integer `k`, remove all elements from list `l` that have a value equal to `k`.

### Example

```
For l = [3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and k = 3, the output should be
solution(l, k) = [1, 2, 4, 5];
For l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and k = 10, the output should be
solution(l, k) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
```

## isListPalindrome

### Task

Note: Try to solve this task in O(n) time using O(1) additional space, where n is the number of elements in l, since this is what you'll be asked to do during an interview.

Given a singly linked list of integers, determine whether or not it's a `palindrome`.

Note: in examples below and tests preview linked lists are presented as arrays just for simplicity of visualization: in real data you will be given a head node l of the linked list

### Example

```
For l = [0, 1, 0], the output should be
solution(l) = true;

For l = [1, 2, 2, 3], the output should be
solution(l) = false.
```

## addTwoHugeNumbers

### Task

You're given 2 huge integers represented by linked lists. Each linked list element is a number from 0 to 9999 that represents a number with exactly 4 digits. The represented number might have leading zeros. Your task is to add up these huge integers and return the result in the same format.

### Example

```
For a = [9876, 5432, 1999] and b = [1, 8001], the output should be
solution(a, b) = [9876, 5434, 0].

Explanation: 987654321999 + 18001 = 987654340000.

For a = [123, 4, 5] and b = [100, 100, 100], the output should be
solution(a, b) = [223, 104, 105].

Explanation: 12300040005 + 10001000100 = 22301040105.
```

## mergeTwoLinkedLists

### Task

Note: Your solution should have `O(l1.length + l2.length)` time complexity, since this is what you will be asked to accomplish in an interview.

Given two singly linked lists sorted in non-decreasing order, your task is to merge them. In other words, return a singly linked list, also sorted in non-decreasing order, that contains the elements from both original lists.

### Example

```
For l1 = [1, 2, 3] and l2 = [4, 5, 6], the output should be
solution(l1, l2) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
For l1 = [1, 1, 2, 4] and l2 = [0, 3, 5], the output should be
solution(l1, l2) = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

## reverseNodesInKGroups

### Task

Note: Your solution should have O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in l, and O(1) additional space complexity, since this is what you would be asked to accomplish in an interview.

Given a linked list l, reverse its nodes k at a time and return the modified list. k is a positive integer that is less than or equal to the length of l. If the number of nodes in the linked list is not a multiple of k, then the nodes that are left out at the end should remain as-is.

You may not alter the values in the nodes - only the nodes themselves can be changed.

### Example

```
For l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and k = 2, the output should be
solution(l, k) = [2, 1, 4, 3, 5];
For l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and k = 1, the output should be
solution(l, k) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
For l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] and k = 3, the output should be
solution(l, k) = [3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 4, 9, 8, 7, 10, 11].
```
