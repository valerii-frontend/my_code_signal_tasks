# Trees: basic

## ðŸ’Ž hasPathWithGivenSum

### Task

Given a binary tree t and an integer s, determine whether there is a root to leaf path in t such that the sum of vertex values equals s.

### Example

```
For

t = {
    "value": 4,
    "left": {
        "value": 1,
        "left": {
            "value": -2,
            "left": null,
            "right": {
                "value": 3,
                "left": null,
                "right": null
            }
        },
        "right": null
    },
    "right": {
        "value": 3,
        "left": {
            "value": 1,
            "left": null,
            "right": null
        },
        "right": {
            "value": 2,
            "left": {
                "value": -2,
                "left": null,
                "right": null
            },
            "right": {
                "value": -3,
                "left": null,
                "right": null
            }
        }
    }
}
and
s = 7,
the output should be solution(t, s) = true.

This is what this tree looks like:

      4
     / \
    1   3
   /   / \
  -2  1   2
    \    / \
     3  -2 -3
Path 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> -2 gives us 7, the required sum.

For

t = {
    "value": 4,
    "left": {
        "value": 1,
        "left": {
            "value": -2,
            "left": null,
            "right": {
                "value": 3,
                "left": null,
                "right": null
            }
        },
        "right": null
    },
    "right": {
        "value": 3,
        "left": {
            "value": 1,
            "left": null,
            "right": null
        },
        "right": {
            "value": 2,
            "left": {
                "value": -4,
                "left": null,
                "right": null
            },
            "right": {
                "value": -3,
                "left": null,
                "right": null
            }
        }
    }
}
and
s = 7,
the output should be solution(t, s) = false.

This is what this tree looks like:

      4
     / \
    1   3
   /   / \
  -2  1   2
    \    / \
     3  -4 -3
There is no path from root to leaf with the given sum 7.
```

## ðŸ’Ž findProfession

### Task

Consider a special family of Engineers and Doctors. This family has the following rules:

Everybody has two children.
The first child of an Engineer is an Engineer and the second child is a Doctor.
The first child of a Doctor is a Doctor and the second child is an Engineer.
All generations of Doctors and Engineers start with an Engineer.
We can represent the situation using this diagram:

                E
           /         \
          E           D
        /   \        /  \
       E     D      D    E
      / \   / \    / \   / \
     E   D D   E  D   E E   D

Given the level and position of a person in the ancestor tree above, find the profession of the person.
Note: in this tree first child is considered as left child, second - as right.

### Example

```
For level = 3 and pos = 3, the output should be
solution(level, pos) = "Doctor".
```
